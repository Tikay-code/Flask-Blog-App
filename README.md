# A Blog App That Build in Flask

In this app users can create and custom their own posts and account

# Post
Users can create a post which have the attributes of:
* delete their post

* add an image to their post

also, if they are the author of the post, they can delete other users comments which are in the post

Users can comment to other users posts, update their comments and delete them


# Account
Users can update their username and image anytime they want

# Login & Register
Users can login and register but they are not have to
Users can be in the app without to register (which I think is good ofc)
